**Please read carefully before starting this exercise.**

You are required to provide forecast intervals for the **percentage reduction** in certain types of hospital activity at the England level over a fifteen-year time horizon under the following scenario:

**Scenario A - steady state community capacity** Capacity (and funding, adjusted for efficiency requirements) of community services grows in line with population growth and inflation, but no more. New initiatives would be through repurposing existing resource.

The focus here is exclusively on hospital activity which may be **mitigated**. You must not incorporate factors which increase hospital activity into your judgements because such factors are accommodated elsewhere in the model.

The app will only offer you those parameters (about 10) which have been allocated to you.

**The app will automatically close on {format_datetime_as_string(get_phase_1_end())}.**
**Please try and complete your assignment before then.**
**If you do not complete all the assignment, we will still endeavour to use what we can.**

For each parameter

1) There is a descriptive text box that provides an outline of why reducing the type of activity is desired along with some information about how the type of activity is identified

2)  There is a plot of historical trends across England. All the parameters are presented at the England level. The plots show data based on routinely collected Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data. The trends are provided for information only.

**Please pay close attention to the vertical axis on each chart as this will tell you the type of change you are forecasting, in many cases it will be the rate of admissions or attendances, but some parameters require different assumptions, for example, about how length of stay might reduce or how the proportion of cases that are undertaken in a particular setting might reduce.**  <br />

    In some instances, the plots may show an unusual change or pattern.
This is likely to reflect data quality issues and/or a change in the clinical coding process.
Please discount these unusual patterns.

#### Your task

1) To review the description and plot for each parameter.

2)  To thoughtfully list out the factors which you think will lead to a surprising (low or high) value under **Scenario A - steady state community capacity**

3) Use the slider to select the lower and upper % values for your forecast based on the factors you have listed. The percentage reductions can only go from 0% (no reduction) to 100% (total reduction).

4) We discourage you from skipping a parameter. If you are completely uncertain, then this is best recorded as a 0% to 100% interval which is the maximum level of uncertainty with supporting text to justify this. However if you must skip a parameter type **skip** in the free text box.

5) Upon completion you will see the final "completed" screen.

6) Your work is automatically saved and the app will remember your progress.
